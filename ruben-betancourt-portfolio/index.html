              <h1>Introduction</h1>
              <p> I have been working for Pearson for the past 18 years. There I gained much experience
                  in school assessments for grades Kindergarden to High School. Enjoyed working with 
                  many states, including Puerto Rico. While working in San Antonio, my team included 
                  co-workers in Iowa, Austin, and India. We had daily meetings thru different media.
                  Pearson has been going thru major adjustments, one has been to eliminate printed media,
                  and move on to digital only. The major downsizing affected me. Thus I am being forced
                  to re-brand myself and work as a Software Developer in new areas. Have decided to 
                  try front end development in web designs.</p>
